TODO:
- Add update functionality to the application.
- The Login page should be more user friendly. Right now, all it has is Login box and it does not tell the user what the login box is for or what the application is for. I should put a brief explanation about the application along with the login box.
- Improve the layout design of the application. (Maybe get rid of the background??)
- Change the texts of the form validation. For example, the current form validation error always outputs "Invalid input." This should be different for each form data.
